Introduction Projectile motion describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance. The motion occurs in two dimensions: horizontal ( \\(x\\) -axis) and vertical ( \\(y\\) -axis). We derive the governing equations starting from Newton\u2019s laws of motion. 2. Equations of Motion Newton\u2019s second law states: \\[ F = m a \\] For projectile motion, the only force acting on the object (neglecting air resistance) is gravity: \\[ F_y = -mg, \\quad F_x = 0 \\] Thus, the acceleration components are: \\[ a_x = 0, \\quad a_y = -g \\] where \\( g \\) is the acceleration due to gravity. Using kinematic equations: 2.1 Horizontal Motion Since there is no horizontal acceleration, \\[ v_x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\] \\[ x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) t \\] 2.2 Vertical Motion Using the kinematic equations for constant acceleration, \\[ v_y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - gt \\] \\[ y = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] 3. Time of Flight The time of flight is found by solving for when the projectile returns to \\( y = 0 \\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2} g t^2 \\] Factoring out \\( t \\) : \\[ t ( v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - \\frac{1}{2} g t ) = 0 \\] Ignoring the trivial solution \\( t = 0 \\) , we solve for \\( t \\) : \\[ t = \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] 4. Range of the Projectile The horizontal range is given by: \\[ R = v_x \\times t_{flight} \\] Substituting \\( v_x = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\) and \\( t_{flight} \\) : \\[ R = v_0 \\cos(\\theta) \\times \\frac{2 v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the identity \\( 2 \\sin(\\theta) \\cos(\\theta) = \\sin(2\\theta) \\) , \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin(2\\theta)}{g} \\] 5. Maximum Height At maximum height, \\( v_y = 0 \\) : \\[ 0 = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) - g t_{max} \\] Solving for \\( t_{max} \\) : \\[ t_{max} = \\frac{v_0 \\sin(\\theta)}{g} \\] Using the vertical displacement equation: \\[ h_{max} = v_0 \\sin(\\theta) t_{max} - \\frac{1}{2} g t_{max}^2 \\] Substituting \\( t_{max} \\) : \\[ h_{max} = \\frac{v_0^2 \\sin^2(\\theta)}{2g} \\] 6. Influence of Initial Conditions Initial Velocity \\( v_0 \\) : Higher velocity increases both range and height. Launch Angle \\( \\theta \\) : The range is maximized at \\( \\theta = 45^\\circ \\) . Gravity \\( g \\) : Higher gravity decreases range and height. 7. Conclusion These equations provide a fundamental description of projectile motion. In further analysis, we will explore numerical simulations and practical applications, including air resistance and varying terrains.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#theoretical-foundation-governing-equations-of-projectile-motion","text":"","title":"Theoretical Foundation: Governing Equations of Projectile Motion"},{"location":"1%20Physics/3%20Waves/Problem_1/#1-introduction","text":"Projectile motion describes the motion of an object under the influence of gravity, assuming no air resistance.
